# MontaVistaCollaboration

## Claim
Newly graduated students of varying education (degrees) levels who are in debt need to know the ideal places for them to live based off of employment rates and house values, because they need to be quickly employed to pay off their debt so they afford a home they want (average house price in that area).

## Goal
Parse datasets into CSV files from which we can generate graphs to explore any correlations in data
